# Notes

## `Zram` vs `Zswap`

- If you **had enough RAM** and/or **didn't want create a swap partition**, use `Zram` as swap.
- If you **had a swap partition**, use `Zswap` to improve performance.

Anyway, **DO NOT USE BOTH AT THE SAME TIME!**

## `home-manager.useUserPackages`

This option determines **how** and **where** Home Manager installs your packages within NixOS.

In short:

* **`false` (Default):** Home Manager behaves like a standalone tool. It creates its own independent environment in `~/.nix-profile`.
* **`true`:** Home Manager integrates tightly with NixOS. It dumps your packages directly into the system-level user profile at `/etc/profiles/per-user/<username>`.

---

### 1. The Visual Difference

The easiest way to understand this is to look at where the packages physically live on your system.

| Option Setting | Install Location | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`false`** | `~/.nix-profile/bin/...` | Home Manager builds its own "generation" distinct from the system. |
| **`true`** | `/etc/profiles/per-user/$USER/bin/...` | NixOS builds the user environment as part of the system build. |

### 2. Deep Dive: How it works

#### When `useUserPackages = false` (Default)

Home Manager acts as an independent layer on top of NixOS.

1. NixOS builds the system.
2. Home Manager runs an "activation script."
3. This script builds a separate package profile and symlinks it to `~/.nix-profile`.
4. You can use `nix-env` alongside this (though not recommended), and `nix-env -q` will show packages installed here.

#### When `useUserPackages = true`

Home Manager acts as a configuration generator for NixOS.

1. It takes all packages defined in your `home.packages` (and enabled programs like `programs.git.enable`).
2. It strictly passes them to the native NixOS option `users.users.<yourname>.packages`.
3. When you run `nixos-rebuild switch`, NixOS handles the installation of these packages into `/etc/profiles/per-user/<yourname>`.
4. **Crucially:** Home Manager **still manages your dotfiles** (like `~/.config/git/config`). It only offloads the *package installation* logic to NixOS.

### 3. Which one should you use?

#### Use `true` if:

* **You want a "Pure NixOS" experience:** You want `nixos-rebuild` to handle everything in one go without a secondary activation step for packages.
* **You want `nixos-rebuild build-vm` to work:** This command often requires user packages to be in `/etc/profiles` to appear inside the VM.
* **You don't use `nix-env`:** If you rely purely on declarative config, this is cleaner.

#### Use `false` if:

* **You share config with non-NixOS systems:** If you use the same `home.nix` on Ubuntu or macOS (where `/etc/profiles` isn't managed by Nix), keeping the default behavior ensures consistency across platforms.
* **You want Home Manager updates decoupled from System updates:** (Rare) You could theoretically update your home environment without `sudo` if it wasn't tied to the system build (though in the NixOS module method, they are usually tied anyway).

### 4. Important Interaction: `useGlobalPkgs`

You will often see `useUserPackages` paired with `useGlobalPkgs`. It is important not to confuse them:

* **`useGlobalPkgs = true`:** Saves time/space. It tells Home Manager to use the **exact same** instance of `nixpkgs` as the system, preventing it from downloading a second copy of the package repository.
* **`useUserPackages = true`:** Changes **installation location**. It moves packages from `~` to `/etc`.

### Recommended Next Step

If you are running a single-user NixOS machine, I generally recommend enabling both for the cleanest integration:

```nix
# In your /etc/nixos/configuration.nix (or flake module)
home-manager = {
  useGlobalPkgs = true;
  useUserPackages = true;
  users.yourusername = import ./home.nix;
};

```
